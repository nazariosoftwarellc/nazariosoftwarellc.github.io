# Nazario Software

I'm [Kyle Nazario](https://www.kylenazario.com/), the sole proprietor of Nazario Software. I make simple, high-quality apps for purchase.

## The website

This is the backing code for [nazariosoftware.com](https://www.nazariosoftware.com/), the public website for my company. The site provides support pages for the apps I publish: marketing materials explaining what the apps do, privacy policies, FAQs, etc.

### Simple static generation

Jekyll isn't the sexiest or newest static site generator, but it's one I'm familiar with and it's effective. Plus it's got a ton of great themes to help you get a great-looking site quickly. 

The code in this repo is the source. Everything gets auto-built by GitHub Pages and served as the public website.
