**Mute Chat for BoardGameArena** is made by me, [Kyle Nazario](https://www.kylenazario.com). I'm an independent software developer who tries to make useful web extensions. Thank you for downloading Mute Chat!

This extension is not affiliated with [BoardGameArena.com](https://boardgamearena.com).

Toolbar chat icons were made by James Kopina at [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) ([one](https://thenounproject.com/icon/chat-icon-3362937/), [two](https://thenounproject.com/icon/chat-icon-3362930/)).
