## How to enable Beautiful New Tabs

## How to remove the toolbar icon

I also recommend removing the BNT toolbar icon.

- Select Customize Toolbar
- Click and drag the BNT toolbar icon up and away from the toolbar
- Release your mouse button and the BNT icon should puff away

## How to change the weather location

Type your location in the search field in the weather box. Press Enter or click the checkmark to save.

## How to change the weather display unit

Type some image query ("nature", minus quotes) in the search field in the lower left. Press Enter or click the checkmark to save. Give it a minute to load the new image - changing your image query means Beautiful New Tabs can't use its existing image cache.
