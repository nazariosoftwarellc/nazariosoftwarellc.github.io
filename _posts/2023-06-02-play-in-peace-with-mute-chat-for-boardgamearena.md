Some days, you just don't feel like talking. **Mute Chat for BoardGameArena** is a simple browser extension that does one thing: when you click the extension's icon in your browser, it hides the chat on [BoardGameArena.com](https://boardgamearena.com). Click the icon again to show the chat. That's it. 

Mute Chat lets you choose whether to mute the site-wide general chat, per-game chats, or the notification "pop" sound. By default, it gets rid of all three. 

Mute Chat does not access your BGA account or track any personal information (see the [full privacy policy]({% post_url 2023-06-02-mute-chat-privacy-policy %}). It just hides the chat.

Mute Chat is free to download on Chrome and $2 on Safari. Purchase once, own forever. No ads, popups or tracking of any kind.
