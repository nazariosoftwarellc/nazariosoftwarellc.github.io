JavaSnipt does not collect any data about its users. Easy!

The sites you add to JavaSnipt are synced through CloudKit. This data is private to your Apple ID and cannot be accessed by me, the developer, or any third-party. 

## JavaSnipt UI for macOS

The **JavaSnipt UI** macOS extension requires permission to read the webpage contents of all webpages. It needs this access so when you click the JavaSnipt toolbar icon, it can read the website shown in the current tab and offer to block that website. Your browsing history is not logged or tracked in any way. 

If you do not wish to enable it, JavaSnipt will still function with just the **JavaSnipt Blocker** extension enabled. You will have to manually add websites in the main JavaSnipt app, however.
