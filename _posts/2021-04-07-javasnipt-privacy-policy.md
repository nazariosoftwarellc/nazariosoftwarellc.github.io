JavaSnipt does not collect any data about its users. Easy!

The sites you add to JavaSnipt are synced through CloudKit. This data is private to your Apple ID and cannot be accessed by me, the developer, or any third-party. 

## JavaSnipt UI for macOS

The **JavaSnipt UI** macOS extension requires permission to read the webpage contents of all webpages. It needs this access so when you click the JavaSnipt toolbar icon, it can read the website shown in the current tab and offer to block that website. Your browsing history is not logged or tracked in any way. 

If you do not wish to enable it, JavaSnipt will still function with just the **JavaSnipt Blocker** extension enabled. You will have to manually add websites in the main JavaSnipt app, however.

## Source Code Nutrition Label

You shouldn't have to worry JavaSnipt is using some privacy-sucking third-party library. You should know what code goes into your apps.

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of third-party code used by apps: those used inside the app, and those used to build the app. 

Code used in the app is included with JavaSnipt's code and will run on your device. For example, if an app shows ads from Facebook, it might include the Facebook SDK (JavaSnipt does neither).

Then there's code used to build the app, which is *not* included with JavaSnipt. It only runs on my computer when I make a new version of the app.

- None
