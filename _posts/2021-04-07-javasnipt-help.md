## FAQs

### Can I block specific scripts? 

As of now, no. This is the most commonly requested feature. Apple offers a pretty limited set of options for Safari content blockers, so I will investigate to see whether this is possible.

### How do I enable the JavaSnipt content blocker?

Open the iOS Settings app. Tap Safari â†’ Content Blockers and tap the toggle to the right of JavaSnipt. Now JavaSnipt can block any site you add to it.

### How do I enable iCloud to sync between my devices?

You must be signed into iCloud on the device using JavaSnipt in order to sync your targeted sites between devices. Use [Apple's walkthrough](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208681) to set up iCloud.

If JavaSnipt cannot store your sites in iCloud, it will store them locally. 

### How do I delete a site from JavaSnipt?

**iOS, in Safari:** Visit the site you wish to remove. Tap Share â†’ JavaSnipt. You will see a popup asking if you want to allow or block JavaScript on that website. Tap OK and refresh. 

**iOS, in JavaSnipt**: Swipe on the site from right to left or tap Edit, then the (-) icon next to the site you wish to remove. 

**macOS, in Safari**: Visit the site you wish to remove. Click the {} icon in the toolbar. Click the button in the dropdown (if the site is currently in JavaSnipt, this button will be green). Click the refresh icon to reload the page. 

**macOS, in JavaSnipt**: Click on the site you wish to remove. Press Cmd-Delete or File â†’ Delete from the menu bar. If you wish to undo this, use Cmd-Z or Edit â†’ Undo. You can select multiple sites for deletion by holding down Shift or Command and clicking on multiple rows.

## Known issues

### JavaSnipt icon does not appear in iOS share menu

This [appears to be an iOS bug](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/662671). I can see it happen on iOS 14.4 in the Simulator but cannot fix it. My workaround is to close and re-open the share sheet - JavaSnipt appears the second time. 

If that does not work, reboot your phone (ðŸ˜– I know, I know) and the JavaSnipt share icon should appear.

### JavaSnipt UI extension for macOS allows users to add sites with the JavaSnipt blocker extension disabled (FB9080144)

Unfortunately, [macOS Safari extensions cannot tell if a content blocker is enabled](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50481113/how-to-get-the-stateenabled-disabled-of-safari-content-blocker-app-extension-f). I can personally verify this bug.
