If you need help with Autofill Email Codes, please send an email describing the exact problem and steps that made the problem occur to [nazariosoftwarellc@gmail.com](mailto:nazariosoftwarellc+aec@gmail.com) and I will do my best to help.

## General

### Why isn't my code showing up?

The email with your login code may not have arrived yet. Use the **Refresh** button at the bottom of the popup to check again. If you're still not seeing it, forward the email with the code to [nazariosoftwarellc@gmail.com](mailto:nazariosoftwarellc+aec@gmail.com).

### Why does AEC require access to my email account?

The app needs access to your email account so it can look through your inbox for login codes. Those codes are presented to you in a window. No other data from your email account is accessed or used. See the [privacy policy]({% post_url 2023-04-14-autofill-email-codes-privacy-policy %}) for more.

### How do I grant AEC permission to run on nazariosoftware.com?

The app needs permission to run on this website, nazariosoftware.com, in order to finish the sign-in process for your email account. 

To grant permission, follow these steps:

#### On Mac

- Open Safari
- In the menu bar, click **Safari**, then **Preferences**
- Click **Websites**, then scroll down in the left panel and click **Autofill Email Codes**
- Scroll down in the right panel and next to nazariosoftware.com, select **Allow** from the dropdown

#### On iOS

- Open the Settings app
- Tap **Safari**, then **Extensions**, then **Autofill Email Codes**
- Tap **nazariosoftware.com** and select **Allow**

### It says data is already being shared with nazariosoftware.com when I log in with Google

You may see this message if you log into Autofill Email Codes from a second device that does not sync with the first device. It is expected and just means the other device can still access your email.
