Beautiful New Tabs does not collect any data about its users.

BNT uses your provided location to load weather data. This information is cached locally on your computer so it can be loaded when you open a new tab. It is not stored or logged anywhere else. [^1]

[^1]: For nerds: It's in `localStorage`.

BNT also stores your image search query locally on your computer so new images can be loaded when you open a new tab. This is also not stored or logged anywhere else.
