Why not look at a beautiful photograph when you open a new tab? 

Beautiful New Tabs is an extension for Safari that replaces your new tab page with a gorgeous wallpaper. Set your image query ("nature" by default) and see random images pulled from Unsplash, a repository for great photographs. 

Beautiful New Tabs also shows the weather for your location. It's a simple, beautiful way to open new tabs.

## Purchasing

Beautiful New Tabs contains no in-app purchases. Buy once and own forever.

## Privacy

Beautiful New Tabs caches your location locally on your computer so it can display the correct weather when you open a new tab. It does not store or share this information with any third party. 

This app does not use any:

- Tracking of any kind
- Third-party software libraries or SDKs

## Other platforms

Beautiful New Tabs is built as a native Safari extension. It does not support Chrome or Firefox. For those browsers, I would recommend [Tabliss](https://tabliss.io) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabliss-a-beautiful-new-t/hipekcciheckooncpjeljhnekcoolahp), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/?src=external-tabliss.io)).
