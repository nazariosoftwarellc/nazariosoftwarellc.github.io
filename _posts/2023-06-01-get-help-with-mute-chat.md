## Changing settings

To change what chats get muted, open the settings panel for the extension.

- **Chrome**: Right click the Mute Chat speech bubble icon and select "Options"
- **Safari (Mac)**: Click "Safari" in the menu bar, then "Settings..." > "Extensions" > "Mute Chat for BoardGameArena" > "Preferences"
- **Safari (iOS)**: Open the Settings app. Go to "Safari" > "Extensions" > "Mute Chat for BoardGameArena" > "Settings"

By default, the extension hides:

- Table chats
- General chat
- Notification noises

It shows private chats by default, but you can hide those as well in the settings.

## FAQ

### How does it work?

Mute Chat for BoardGameArena simply hides the chat windows on BGA and mutes the notification pop in your browser window. That's it. 

### Will this affect my BGA account?

No. This extension collects zero data of any kind.

### Will this extension affect the other people in a game? 

No, it just hides and mutes chats for you. 

### Will other people know I am muting them?

No. You just won't see their messages.

### Will this block people from messaging me?

No. As soon as you stop hiding the chat, you'll see any messages you may have missed. 

### Can I show messages from my friends?

Not at the moment. There is no simple way to filter messages from non-friends. There's probably a creative way to do it, but BGA has strict rules against extracting player information that I don't want to cross.
