## Make your new tab page gorgeous with Beautiful New Tabs

Why not look at a beautiful photograph when you open a new tab?

Beautiful New Tabs is an extension for Safari that replaces your new tab page with a gorgeous wallpaper. Images are pulled from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), a repository for beautiful photographs. Images can be anything you want - nature, cats, lizards or fruit, anything.

Beautiful New Tabs also shows the weather for your location. The interface for the weather and the rest of the page responds to dark and light mode, looking good on any theme.

Try a simple, beautiful way to open new tabs.

### Purchasing

### Privacy

### Other platforms

Beautiful New Tabs is built as a native Safari extension. It does not support Chrome or Firefox. For those browsers, I would recommend [Tabliss](https://tabliss.io) ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabliss-a-beautiful-new-t/hipekcciheckooncpjeljhnekcoolahp), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/?src=external-tabliss.io)).
