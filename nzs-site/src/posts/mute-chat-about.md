Some days, you just don't feel like talking. **Mute Chat for BoardGameArena** is a simple browser extension that does one thing: when you click the extension's icon in your browser, it hides the chat on [BoardGameArena.com](https://boardgamearena.com). Click the icon again to show the chat. That's it.

Mute Chat lets you choose whether to mute the site-wide general chat, per-game chats, private messages or the notification "pop" sound. By default, it gets rid of all them except private messages.

Mute Chat does not access your BGA account or track any personal information (see the [full privacy policy]({% post_url 2023-06-02-mute-chat-privacy-policy %})). It just hides the chat. No ads, popups or tracking of any kind.
