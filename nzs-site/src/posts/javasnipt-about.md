## Block JavaScript in Safari with JavaSnipt

The web has too many popups and third-party scripts. It wasn't designed to respect your privacy, battery life, data cap or phone-sized screen. Take back control with JavaSnipt. 

This app blocks JavaScript on any website. That means no more:

- Ads
- Newsletter popups
- Cookie requests
- Wasted megabytes of third-party JavaScript libraries

When you encounter a website with too much JavaScript, handling it is simple. On iOS, tap Share → JavaSnipt → refresh. On macOS, click the JavaSnipt toolbar button → hand icon → refresh. Voilà! No more interactivity. 

Alternatively, you can use JavaSnipt to block JavaScript on *all* websites and allow only sites you trust. It's up to you!

Some sites, like YouTube, will not work with JavaScript blocked. That's why JavaSnipt targets only sites you select. 

### Purchasing

By purchasing JavaSnipt on iOS or macOS, you will also unlock the other platform. Your blocked sites sync between all your devices via iCloud.

JavaSnipt contains no in-app purchases. Buy once and unlock forever.

### Privacy

JavaSnipt stores your data in a private iCloud store connected to your Apple ID. 

It does not use any:

- Tracking of any kind
- Third-party software libraries of any kind

### Other platforms

JavaSnipt is built from the ground-up as a native Safari extension. It does not support Chrome or Firefox. For those browsers, I would recommend [NoScript](https://noscript.net) for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/).

### How it works

JavaSnipt blocks specified website domains from loading any additional JS files. Unless a website puts their JS inline in the HTML, which is uncommon, it cannot use any JavaScript. 

This is the best solution I found since there is no way to disable JavaScript at the browser level per-domain. 

### What's with the crab?

That's Snippy, the JavaSnipt mascot. Think of this app as him snipping away the extra `<script>` tags.
